FT_changelog.txt

This is a record of changes we've made to the fieldtrip toolbox.

Whenever possible, save a copy of a function (keeping the same file name) to ft_development, and add this folder to the matlab path above the FT toolbox.

However, if in some cases it's necessary to change a function within the FT toolbox (because there are too many dependencies, etc), then save the original FT function by appending 0 to the end of the name and make a new copy of the function with the original name, in which you make your change. Keep a record of the change here under your initials. Copy the lines you changed, which should include a comment describing the change.
